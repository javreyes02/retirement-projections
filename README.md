This project is inspired by Bankrate's retirement calculator: https://www.bankrate.com/retirement/retirement-plan-calculator/. This version is intended to work better for those individuals 
who do not use income-based rules to determine investing and spending. 

There are two main model updates:
1. Allow the user to define a nominal amount of retirement investments (instead of scaled by income).
2. Remove the retirement spending floor that is a function of the final income before retirement.
